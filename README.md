# Backend Lab

A collection of Node.js backend experiments I'm working on at UPES—perfect for building fundamentals and explaining your code live in class.

##  About This Repo

This repository contains the first set of backend practice experiments I’ve completed, covering core concepts such as:

1. **Exporting objects** using the `exports` object in modules.  
2. **Exporting nested objects and functions** with the `exports` object.  
3. Creating a **basic HTTP server** with request-response logic using `http.createServer()`.  
4. **Reading files asynchronously** with error handling using `fs.readFile()`.  
5. Serving a **text file over HTTP** using both `http` and `fs` modules.

These exercises reinforce Node.js fundamentals and give you concrete, runnable examples to explain in your class.
